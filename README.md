>SOC Cybersecurity Analysis Project
Project Overview
This repository contains my work from Task 2 of my cybersecurity internship at Future Interns, where I performed Security Operations Center (SOC) analysis using real-world simulation scenarios.

> Objective
Simulate the daily activities of a SOC analyst by:

Monitoring security alerts and analyzing potential threats

Identifying suspicious activities from system logs

Creating incident response reports with actionable remediation steps

Building interactive dashboards for threat visualization

What I Accomplished
1. Log Analysis & Threat Detection
Analyzed 47 security events from system logs spanning July 3, 2025

Identified 4 critical security incidents requiring immediate attention

Used Splunk as the SIEM tool for data ingestion and analysis

2. Critical Incidents Identified
Incident	User	Threat Type	Severity	Impact
Ransomware Behavior	Bob	Ransomware	High	Potential data encryption and ransom demands
Spyware Detection	Alice	Spyware	High	Credential theft and data exfiltration risk
Worm Infection	Bob	Worm	Medium-High	Network-wide propagation potential
Rootkit Activity	Eve & Alice	Rootkit	Critical	Deep system compromise and persistent access
3. Dashboard Creation
Built a Splunk dashboard featuring:

User-based threat analysis showing high-risk individuals

Malware distribution across different threat types

Incident frequency by user and threat category

Threat severity mapping for prioritized response

4. Incident Response Documentation
Created comprehensive incident reports including:

 Timeline analysis with precise timestamps

 Impact assessment for each threat type

 Remediation strategies with step-by-step actions

 Priority classification
