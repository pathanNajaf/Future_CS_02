Future Interns Cybersecurity Task 2 Incident Report: 
 
This document is the part of my second tasks of the internship at Future Interns. 
In this task, I was given a log file containing record of user activity on a website. My goal was to analyze the log and list at least three to five instances of potentially malicious activity. 
 
The following is a detailed overview of the suspicious acitiviites detected with a description of the potential risks if they are not addressed. 
 
Incident 1- Ransomware Behaviour  
➢	User: Bob 
➢	Severity: High 
➢	Timeline: 2025-07-03/ 09:10:14  ➢ IP: 172.16.0.3 ➢ Impact: 
The user was flagged with suspicious encryption acitivity that indicates ransomware patterns. This can lead to critical data being encrypted to demand a ransom. 
➢	Remediation:  
Isolate the affected system ASAP from the network and run malware scans, and restore data from backups. 
 
   
Incident 2: Spyware 
➢	User: Alice 
➢	Severity: High 
➢	IP: 172.16.0.3 
➢	Timeline: 2025-07-03/ 04:41:14 ➢ Impact: 
Spyware can monitor key activities, capture screenshots, and/or steal credentials and browsing data. 
➢	Remediation: 
Remove spyware using the specific tools like MalwareBytes, reset affected accounts, and enable enhanced monitoring for suspicious outbound traffic. 
  
 
 
 
Incident 3: Worm infection attempt 
➢	User: Bob 
➢	Severity: Medium to high(Depends on what it does) 
➢	IP: 203.0.113.77 
➢	Timeline: 2025-07-03 05:06:14 ➢ Impact: 
Can disrupt the whole network, increase load on system, 
corrupt data, and exploit vulnerabilities, ➢ Remediation: 
-Immediately block suspicious IP addresses and isolate 
compromised devices 
-Perform a full scan across all connected devices as worm spreads from device to device 
-Review and update firewall criteria for information flow 
-Educate users and employees about avoiding untrusted network share
  
 
Incident 4: Rootkit Detected 
➢	User: Eve And Alice  
➢	Severity: Critical. Operates at deep system level, often kernel 
➢	IP: 10.0.0.5(Eve) & 198.51.100.42(Alice) ➢ Timeline: 2025-07-03 From 04:19:14 To 07:51:14  ➢ Impact: 
Can give attacker a persistent administrative access to systems, bypassing security controls. It can lead to complete system compromise, credential stolen, data exfiltration and long term espionage without detection ➢ Remediation: 
-Isolate the affected system immediately to prevent lateral movement 
-Perform a forensic analysis to confirm presence and type of rootkit 
-Rootkits are fully removable, thus backing up and then reinstalling the whole OS is highly recommended
